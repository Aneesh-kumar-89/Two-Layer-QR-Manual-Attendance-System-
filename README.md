# Two-Layer-QR-Manual-Attendance-System-

Attendance System introduces a hybrid model for attendance tracking: 
1. QR Code Gate Authentication – confirms student arrival. 
2. Manual Professor Attendance – ensures in-class presence. 

This system replaces biometric scanners with a cost-effective, local Python-based solution.
